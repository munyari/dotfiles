# Dotfiles

These are the configuration files that I use on my Linux box (currently
ArchLinux). I hope to make these somewhat platform agnostic, as well as unifying
my neovim and vim configurations.

## Getting started

### Requirements:
[Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) v2.3.0+, and the
[toml-rb](https://github.com/emancu/toml-rb) gem.
[Bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler) is recommended to manage gem
dependencies.

In your interactive shell, run

```bash
chmod +x install
```
then run

```
./install
```

**NOTE:** This doesn't actually work yet. I'm working on it.
